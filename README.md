# UNI-Combo-Trials
This is a mod for UNDER NIGHT IN-BIRTH II Sys:Celes that adds in more missions for every character.

## Installation.
1. If you have any conflicting mods (makes changes to oMtaqooqotvvonnpwmq) then uninstall them or you will have to manually hex edit/make the mod compatible.
2. Extract all the files to the root of the UNI2 folder. (__English and d folders should be next to uni2.exe).
3. Boot up the game, and if your language isn't already set to English, set it to English.

## Current Progress
- Added 4 Wagner combos from the [Wagner Combo Doc](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1mLtjPVEFCC5HSPANTUXbnChpNhzEkSmp2nOIcf_F7AQ/edit?usp=sharing) by Vais.

## To Do:
- Fix the second combo bc it requires 66FF but I'm not sure how to implement it yet.
- Everything else, if you want to request a character/specific combo then ping me in discord or open an issue.
