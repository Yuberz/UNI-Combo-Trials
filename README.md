# UNI-Combo-Trials
This is a mod for UNDER NIGHT IN-BIRTH II Sys:Celes that adds in more missions for every character.

## Installation
1. Download the latest [release](https://github.com/Yuberz/UNI-Combo-Trials/releases).
2. If you have any conflicting mods (makes changes to oMtaqooqotvvonnpwmq) then uninstall them or you will have to manually hex edit/make the mod compatible.
3. Extract all the files to the root of the UNI2 folder. (__English and d folders should be next to uni2.exe).
4. Boot up the game, and if your language isn't already set to English, set it to English.
