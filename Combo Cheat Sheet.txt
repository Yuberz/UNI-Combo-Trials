## STEPS TO ADD YOUR OWN COMBOS
1. Open __English/System/str_jp/stringfile_tutorial.csv
2. Search for "custom" to find where all the custom text definitions are.
3. You need to add a line for every custom mission and category. It's pretty self explanitory. I use a comment to write which character it's for, then the categories then the mission descriptions.
4. Open __English/grpdat/tutorial/_define.txt
5. Search for "custom" to find where custom infos/categories are. Make sure to increment the category number. Add all of the text.
6. Open the respective character folder in __English/grpdat/tutorial/.
000 = Hyde
001 = Linne
002 = Waldstein
003 = Carmine
004 = Orie
005 = Gordeau
006 = Merkava
007 = Vatista
008 = Seth
009 = Yuzuriha
010 = Hilda
011 = Eltnum
012 = Nanase
013 = Byakuya
014 = Akatsuki
015 = Chaos
016 = Wagner
017 = Enkidu
018 = Londrekia
019 = Tsurugi
020 = Uzuki
021 = Mika
022 = Kaguya
023 = Kuon
024 = Phonon

7. Open _info.txt
8. Add new combos AFTER the last combo, the rest should be self explanitory.
9. When making combos, ignore stringID. Fill it with something random, it's for replays.

## TROUBLESHOOTING

- Make sure that the title, position, etc. are in quotation marks.
- Make sure that you didn't miss any of the text definitions. (Steps 1 and 4)
- Mistakes often happen with move notation. Try removing the combo and troubleshooting it move by move.
- If there is a move that is impossible to notate/isn't detected, ping me in discord.


## POSITIONS
Nothing = round start position
微遠 = Slightly far away
近距離 = Close, about just out of 5A ranges.
端背負い = Point Blank, back to left corner.
端 = Corner
中央 = Center?
中距離 = Midscreen? Appears to be round start? Useless?
中央微遠 = Midscreen far away, useful for assault starters

## METER
Nothing = 0 meter
EX = 1 meter
IW = 2 meters
CS = Vorpal
Can be stacked. EXCS = 1 meter + vorpal.

## OPPONENT STATUS
屈 = Crouching?
立 = Stand Blocking

## Combo Notation
X + Y = X and Y have to be pressed simultaneously
dX = Delay X
(X) = whiff X
JX = Jumping X
jc = jump cancel
TK.X = Tiger Knee X? (doesn't seem to work)
iX = increase X
>X = X is a followup
X(#) = X should only hit # times.
lX = X should be done after landing 
hX = X should be held even after the attack (Negative edge)
CS = Chain Shift
CVO = Crosscast Veil Off
CIW = Infinite worth using A+B+C while in CVO
IW = Infinite Worth 41236D.
IWEX = Infinite Worth EX A+B+C+D
_ = prefix, meaning that it's a setup.

i comes before J in notation, so j.[C] would be "iJC"

Example combo:
{	tmp.append( { title="INSERT TITLE HERE",
	cat=CATNUM,
	pos="POSITION",
	enemy="STATUS",
	gauge = "METER",
	stringID="wag_lv1_ss01",
	expl = Def_TCInfo_Expl_UseGauge,
	skill={ recipe = ["2B","C","SS","IW"] }, } );
}


Character Specifics:

Wagner (chr016):
Use "Wag66FF" to detect 66FF.
j.4FF is just JFF internally.

Mika (chr021):
To do j.AA, you do JA > JA_JA.
To do her followups off of 236X, it is always 236_addXA where X is the direction in numpad notation. Specifically for the EX version it has to be J236EX,J236EX_addXC.
For 623 followups, do 623X,>623_AddX
To do 22A~X, do 22A,>MikaAdd
