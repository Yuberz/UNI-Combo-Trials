	pos="POSITION",
	enemy="STATUS",
	gauge = "METER",
	stringID="wag_lv1_ss01",
	expl = Def_TCInfo_Expl_UseGauge,
	skill={ recipe = ["2B","C","SS","IW"] }, } );
}

Character Specifics:

Wagner (chr016):
Use "Wag66FF" to detect 66FF.
j.4FF is just JFF internally.

Mika (chr021):
To do j.AA, you do JA > JA_JA.
To do her followups off of 236X, it is always 236_addXA where X is the direction in numpad notation. Specifically for the EX version it has to be J236EX,J236EX_addXC.
For 623 followups, do 623X,>623_AddX
To do 22A~X, do 22A,>MikaAdd
